# Color Converter #

Included in this repo is a WIP suite of color conversion tools, each implemented in HTML/Javascript. We recommend using the latest browsers, as some of the Javascript we use is not supported on older browsers.

To use any of the tools, open up the HTML file. Then input the colors you want where each value is separated by `,` and each color is separated by `;`.

<h1 id="writing-goals">Writing Goals</h1>
<p>One of the skills I am continually trying to improve is my ability to write<br />goals (i.e., outcomes) for research. Well written goals help communicate the<br />purpose of proposed research, enact evaluatable deadlines, and help outside<br />collaborators better understand your work even if they are not familiar with<br />your domain. The contents of this are mostly for my own purposes and developing<br />as a researcher, and made publicly available in the hopes that others might find<br />my thoughts useful for their own development.</p>
<h2 id="shitty-first-draft">Shitty first draftâ„¢</h2>
<p>Don't worry about refining from the get go. Write down what you want to do<br />without thoughts of clarity (so long as it is clear to you).</p>
<h2 id="reduce-reuse-recycle">Reduce, reuse, recycle</h2>
<p>Chances are that you are writing goals that are thematically similar to goals<br />you have written before and then have received feedback from your advisor on.<br />Use these to your advantage, don't let them go to waste. Borrow language<br />and preemptively take past advice to quickly iterate on your first draft.</p>
<h2 id="be-specific-be-quantifiable">Be specific, be quantifiable</h2>
<p>Avoid terms like &quot;better,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; and &quot;improve.&quot; Better how? What is good? What<br />will you do to improve? Be quantifiable.</p>
<h2 id="phrase-goals-as-outcomes">Phrase goals as outcomes</h2>
<p>View your work in terms of what the output will be, not the process of the<br />output. Doing this will help you write more active rather than passive goals.</p>

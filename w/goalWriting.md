Writing Goals
=============

One of the skills I am continually trying to improve is my ability to write
goals (i.e., outcomes) for research. Well written goals help communicate the
purpose of proposed research, enact evaluatable deadlines, and help outside
collaborators better understand your work even if they are not familiar with
your domain. The contents of this are mostly for my own purposes and developing
as a researcher, and made publicly available in the hopes that others might find
my thoughts useful for their own development.

## Shitty first draftâ„¢
Don't worry about refining from the get go. Write down what you want to do
without thoughts of clarity (so long as it is clear to you).

## Reduce, reuse, recycle
Chances are that you are writing goals that are thematically similar to goals
you have written before and then have received feedback from your advisor on.
Use these to your advantage, don't let them go to waste. Borrow language
and preemptively take past advice to quickly iterate on your first draft.

## Be specific, be quantifiable
Avoid terms like "better," "good," and "improve." Better how? What is good? What
will you do to improve? Be quantifiable.
